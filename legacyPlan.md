## Yusuf A. & Sang O.

To reach the required 500 points for the project, we plan to do the following:

1. We will start by refactoring the code for the pause menu since it is the segment of the code we are most familiar with.

2. After refactoring the code for the pause screen, we will work on fixing the glitch that causes multiple pause screens to show up.

3. We will restructure the code of the entire game to be based on a game loop. This will allow the game state to update even when a key is not pressed. Fixing this issue will allow us and future groups to add more features to the game.

4. We will finalize the timer, which required us to make the game loop first.

This should add up to approximately 500 points. If it falls a few points short, we can implement the randomized map generator. The easiest way we can think of to do that currently is to have a breadth first search to confirm that there is a path from the starting point to each treasure.
